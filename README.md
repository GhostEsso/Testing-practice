# Testing-practice
In these exercises, we focused on writing unit tests for different JavaScript functions. We followed the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern to structure the tests and ensure proper testing coverage. By writing tests, we were able to verify the expected behavior of the functions and ensure their correctness, leading to more reliable and maintainable code.
